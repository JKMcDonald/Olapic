I began by creating a Rails project to structure a server where I could pull from the API, although I am aware there is much moroe to a rails app than this project calls for I wanted to utilize its format for the Server and the MVC project structure. I retrieved the pictures from the Olapic API from an AJAX request where I called a get request on the server for the given endpoint where the media was stored on the server. I authenticated the process with a token and injected the rendered images using a "for" loop to iterate through up to 5 photos. I am a little rusty with my CSS and tried to utilize FlexBox to create a flexible Div where I could display the images and position them off of each other to imitate the Adidas Product page although I was not able to find the CSS combination of layout features to display the thumbnail images on top of one another. Although I was able to display them on the page and enjoyed the process of acquiring them. I will brush up on my CSS between now and the next time we connect.
